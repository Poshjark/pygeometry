# pygeometry
This code is very similar in functions with https://github.com/Poshjark/CppGeometry. Diffrence is just language and start date of developing. This repository was created earlier because Python is easier in prototyping and constructing. 

This program is planned to execute following functions:

1) To manage and edit geometry objects like vectors, polylines and arcs.
2) Make equidistant from geometry objects.
3) Show plot(drawing) of this objects.
4) Generate G-code (My cnc-machine is compatible with .plt extension, so it's preferred) and save it to work directory.
Though g-code generation has last place in functions list it's my main subject, because it's not comfortable to open specific applications just to draw few squares or make control program for cutting stripes.
